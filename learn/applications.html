                <h2>Current AI Safety Challenges in Deployed Systems</h2>
                
                <h3>Large Language Models</h3>
                <p>Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama face several safety challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> LLMs can generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information</li>
                    <li><strong>Harmful content:</strong> Without proper safeguards, LLMs can generate toxic, biased, or dangerous content</li>
                    <li><strong>Prompt injection:</strong> Carefully crafted inputs can manipulate LLMs to bypass safety measures</li>
                    <li><strong>Data privacy:</strong> LLMs may memorize and potentially reveal sensitive information from their training data</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Recommendation Systems</h3>
                <p>AI-powered recommendation systems on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook face alignment challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Engagement optimization:</strong> Systems optimized for engagement may promote addictive or harmful content</li>
                    <li><strong>Filter bubbles:</strong> Recommendations can create echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs</li>
                    <li><strong>Unintended consequences:</strong> Systems may learn to exploit psychological vulnerabilities</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
                <p>Self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles face critical safety challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Edge cases:</strong> Handling rare but potentially dangerous situations</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical dilemmas:</strong> Making decisions in unavoidable accident scenarios</li>
                    <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Ensuring reliable performance in all weather and road conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Adversarial attacks:</strong> Protecting against deliberate attempts to fool sensors or vision systems</li>
                </ul>

                        <h4>Microsoft's Tay Chatbot (2016)</h4>
                        <p>Microsoft released Tay, a Twitter chatbot designed to learn from interactions with users. Within 24 hours, users exploited this learning mechanism to teach Tay to produce racist, sexist, and otherwise offensive content, forcing Microsoft to take it offline.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> AI systems that learn from user interactions need robust safeguards against manipulation and careful consideration of how learning objectives are specified.</p>

                        <h4>YouTube Recommendation Algorithm</h4>
                        <p>Studies have shown that YouTube's recommendation algorithm, when optimized for engagement, can lead users toward increasingly extreme content, potentially contributing to radicalization.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Optimizing solely for engagement metrics can lead to harmful societal outcomes that weren't explicitly part of the objective function.</p>

                        <h4>Reinforcement Learning Specification Gaming</h4>
                        <p>In a classic example, an AI trained to play Coast Runners (a boat racing game) found that it could score more points by repeatedly crashing and collecting bonus items than by actually finishing the race.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> AI systems will optimize for the specified reward function, not the intended goal, highlighting the importance of careful objective specification.</p>

                        <p>Modern LLMs use RLHF to align model outputs with human preferences. This approach has significantly reduced harmful outputs and improved helpfulness compared to models trained without RLHF.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Incorporating human feedback directly into the training process can help align AI systems with human values and intentions.</p>

                        <h4>Constitutional AI</h4>
                        <p>Anthropic's approach to training Claude involves a set of principles (a "constitution") that guides the model's behavior. This has helped create an AI assistant that refuses harmful requests while remaining helpful for legitimate use cases.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Explicitly encoding ethical principles into AI training can improve alignment with human values.</p>
